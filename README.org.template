* TODO Introduction

* Purpose

This is here shared with the idea that some might find it useful for
personal experiments and toys--that's all I'm using it for. It might
also be cautionarily if not pedagogically useful. All that said, it
should not be expected to have any desireable characteristics or be
useful in any way.

Non-personal use (for example, commercial) is forbidden.

Non-casual personal use is strongly discouraged.

* Instructions

To use:

1. Clone repository
2. Run =make install= this will install it into
   ~{{system_path}}/{{system_name}}~
3. in REPL =(require "asdf")= (as needed)
4. =(require "{{system_name}}")=

The package defines a nickname of ~{{abbrev_name}}~ for convenience.

The test package is simply Lisp assertions and loads with the rest of
the system. If the system loads without errors all the tests passed.
